It acts similar to apps sliding behaviours in App store. There are both Objective-C (do not update anymore since v1.3) and Swift version available and they perform exactly the same function, please find whichever you like.

Please note that from now on, the objective-C source won't be updated anymore as I have been using Swift for all my works totally.

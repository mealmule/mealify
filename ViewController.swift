//                Added functionality to yesterday, today, and tomorrow buttons
//                Added functionality to add breakfast, add lunch, add dinner buttons
//                Added firebase to retrieve all information from database
//                Deleted days, and breakfast, lunch, and dinner
//                Fixed duplicate bug where add meals would add multiple meals
